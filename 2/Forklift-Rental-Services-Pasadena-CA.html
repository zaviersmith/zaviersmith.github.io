An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
<p>In the mid-1940s, producers started to make rough terrain forklifts. Moreover, the increasing effort from the end users to efficiently utilize supply chain will create demand for Pallet Trucks to handle large number of transaction expected to further increase in the coming years as well.

Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets.</p>

<p>There are many ways in which Linde is driving the development of its pallet trucks and pallet lift trucks forward. Rough terrain forklifts are designed for two things: lifting and moving loads. Unlike other forklifts, these material handling vehicles don't have cabs. If you're working full time, we understand that it's difficult to get the time off to be able to complete an order picker training course and that's why we offer weekend LO licence courses regularly.</p>
