There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>The maximum height of lift truck forks when the mast of the lift truck has reached full extension. Winners of the FLTA ‘Archie' in Safety Excellence for the Pro 5 Series of Electric Trucks with its inbuilt Auto-Slow Down function.
