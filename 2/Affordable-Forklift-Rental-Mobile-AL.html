<p>Some dealers will sell lifted trucks, but you may be more likely to find them through alternative means, like custom shops.

<p>As mentioned in the preceding section, replacing or adding an attachment may reduce (down-rate) the safe lifting capacity of the forklift truck (See also General operations, below).
