An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
<p>Powerhouses like the Ford F-150 already command the road, but lifted trucks provide that extra level of customization that demand attention. Order picker trucks are another type of Class II electric motor narrow aisle truck. Rough terrain forklifts come in 2WD and 4WD variants; however, 4WD variant is the all-rounder that can accomplish all kinds of difficult tasks on rough terrain.</p>
