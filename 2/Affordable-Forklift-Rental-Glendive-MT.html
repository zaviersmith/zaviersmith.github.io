<p>All personnel required to operate a Industrial Counterbalance Forklift Truck should complete this training and testing.

This type of forklift is suited for uneven surfaces with its sturdy pneumatic tires. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>

Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>
