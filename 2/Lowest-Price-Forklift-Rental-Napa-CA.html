<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.

<p>For the same loadcapacity, forklifts differ in 3 main ways. This includes Forklift tyres, Spares and Pallet Jacksat competitive prices. Whether they be a factory-floor, rough terrain, or telehandler machine, forklifts often face far harder service than most farm machinery. Although a primitive pissing contest in the eyes of some, the lifted-truck community does get down and dirty in some sections; namely the mudder section.</p>
<p>Local businesses that recently purchased a new forklift may be selling the used model directly. As one of the leading manufacturers of materials handling equipment , including a sizable range of counterbalance forklift trucks, our products are designed to withstand even the harshest of environments.

However, statistics show that companies that own their fleets tend to keep their forklifts longer than financially makes sense.</p>
