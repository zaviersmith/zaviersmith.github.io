<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>

<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability.

Pallet trucks are the efficient and simple mode of transporting palletized loads on the shop floor. Suspension lifts can enable steeper approach, departure, and breakover angles, higher ground clearance, and helps accommodate larger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028. This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. This type of lift is more expensive than a body lift and requires making changes to the mechanical system or suspension of the truck. The walkie stacker has a subtype: the order picker forklift.</p>

<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in.
