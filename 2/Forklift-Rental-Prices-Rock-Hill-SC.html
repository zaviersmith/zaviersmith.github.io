For individuals who do exclusively on-road driving and no hauling, the only noticeable benefit is the lifted line of sight and boosted aesthetic. Because of the high initial cost, almost all forklifts are either rented or financed.</p>

<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle.

This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
