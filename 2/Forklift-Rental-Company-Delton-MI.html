<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Always has the largest selection of New or Used Forklifts Equipment for sale anywhere. Another subtype of warehouse forklift, the counterbalance forklift, looks like a standard warehouse forklift—except it has no extending arms for the forward forks and the back is weighted to counterbalance the load. Another major reason why accidents occur is due to improper loading and unloading of the forklift.</p>

<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail.

<p>Understand the causes of instability of the truck and loads. We're always out looking for a great deal on a pre-owned forklift, so that we can be the main source you look to when you are wanting to purchase one.

<p>With FLC's training, they'll learn how to properly and safely drive both regular and three-wheel counterbalance lifts, maneuver their way through tight spaces, properly handle and travel with heavy loads and avoid collisions, falling objects and other types of accidents. Don't pay for a 5,000 lb. capacity truck to move 2,000 lbs. If it is not meant for roller chain pulleys then forklifts would require much taller cylinders to lift up the load to an equivalent height.</p>
