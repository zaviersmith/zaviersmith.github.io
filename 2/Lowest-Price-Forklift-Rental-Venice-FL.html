<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Our counterbalance forklift training courses follow a specific set of guidelines as determined by NPORS & ITSSAR to ensure your staff are trained to the highest standard. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front. It is nice to have the selection of on-line, PPT, and video training to choose from., and the additional materials and forms made setting up our forklift safety program a snap.</p>
<p>We offer Forklift and Crane Rental Services at cost-effective prices. The counterbalance” term refers to the weight distribution for cargo loads; any pallets or merchandise are counterbalanced against the weight of the machine. Forklifts vary in brand, size and purpose. Ask a mechanic to check the forklift for potential problems that you have identified or might have overlooked.</p>

Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements. The standard course is intended to last for 5 days but for an experienced Forklift Truck Operator who holds a valid or recently expired certificate, a 3 day refresher can be attended.</p>
