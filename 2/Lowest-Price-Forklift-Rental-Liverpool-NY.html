<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>

When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>

Able to lift up to 8 t, these forklifts are rugged and suited for outdoor applications. Beginning mechanics may be surprised by the complexity of lifting a truck, particularly if the added height exceeds three inches.</p>
