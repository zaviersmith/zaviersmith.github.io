With proper care and maintenance, a lifted truck provides many benefits for the off-road adventure seeker. We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>

Powered by large, heavy lead-acid batteries, electric forklifts typically provide enough power for one standard eight-hour shift or about five to six hours of continuous use.
