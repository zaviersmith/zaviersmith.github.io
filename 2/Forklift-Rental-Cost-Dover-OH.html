<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Safe operation requires advanced skill and training in forklift usage, and specific protocols should be followed to ensure safety of the operator and others in the vicinity. There will never be a shortage of other truck lovers who want a lifted truck. A sit-down electric reach truck with a 4,500 lb capacity might cost around $30,000 to $40,000.

One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition.
