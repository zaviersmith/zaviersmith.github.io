Outdoor forklifts use pneumatic tires with deep treads and more ground clearance to make them easier to drive on rough terrains. The operator stands in a sideways compartment and the side loader unloads objects on its side. When we start talking about lifting trucks, lift kits, etc.</p>
<p>Side Loader popularity has been declining due to the more advanced multi-directional forklift that has taken its place as the king of long load handling. We've got forklifts reserved and maintained for rental customers, with everything from forklift hand pallet trucks, powered pallet truck forklifts and stacking forklifts through to 12 tonne forklifts and specialised very narrow aisle equipment.</p>
