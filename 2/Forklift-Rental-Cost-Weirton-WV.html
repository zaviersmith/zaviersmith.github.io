<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>
<p>Telehandlers provide substantial lift heights over standard forklifts. Considering the materials handling industry's recent development in automation, real-time responsiveness and end-to-end efficiency are building communication between the management of forklift trucks and people who operate them. LP, gas diesel, electric, pneumatic or cushion, we have the forklift rental you need.</p>

<p>Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them.

Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>
<p>Even among lift kits, there are smaller options that just level out the truck from the common nose down” factory settings and others that will make your truck tall enough to walk under. Browse Order Picker Truck Equipment. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets weighing 3,000 - 6,000lbs.</p>
