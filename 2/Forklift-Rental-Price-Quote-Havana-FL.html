Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
