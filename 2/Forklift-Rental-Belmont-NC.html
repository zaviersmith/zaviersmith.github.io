While some lifts, like body lifts, are actually pretty straightforward, a mighty suspension lift can require a lot of extra considerations, parts, and work.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E.
