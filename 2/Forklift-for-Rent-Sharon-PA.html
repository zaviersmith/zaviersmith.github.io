<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup.

As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
