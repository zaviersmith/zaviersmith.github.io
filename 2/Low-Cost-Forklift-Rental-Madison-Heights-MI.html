<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Our range of Super Short Hand Pallet Truck is scientifically designed to achieve maximum production capacity with minimum human efforts.

Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
<p>Even among lift kits, there are smaller options that just level out the truck from the common nose down‚Äù factory settings and others that will make your truck tall enough to walk under.
