One of the most popular adjustments to trucks is the lift kit - moving the entire truck higher in the air by changing out suspension parts. About 92% of these are forklifts, 1% are material handling equipment parts. This purchasing guide will examine the specific features that qualify the machines to be considered 'rough terrain'.</p>

Finally, take the inspection to the road and see how the lifted truck performs on a bumpy terrain. Oftentimes, pallet jacks are used to move and organize pallets inside a trailer, especially when there is no forklift truck access or availability.</p>
