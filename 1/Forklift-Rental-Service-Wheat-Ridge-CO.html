In England a 40-cell unit has been used to drive a forklift truck and to do electric welding. When you see a sharp increase in production demand or need to supplement your core fleet, forklift rentals provide a cost-effective solution to keep production moving.</p>
<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism.
