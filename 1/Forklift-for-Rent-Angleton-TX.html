<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. For pallet jacks that can weigh for dual efficiency, contact METTLER TOLEDO.

The damage that can be done by this forklift can be to objects and people other than the operator.

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.
