Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use. Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well.

If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be.

Lifted Jeeps are particularly popular for driving off-road and on rough terrain due to their additional ground clearance and the ability to use larger tires and wheels.

<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that there are no set rules for exactly how much a used forklift should price, and a whole lot will also depend on the demand and supply of used forklifts in your town. Generally speaking the reach truck will be less expensive new, used or leased than a sit-down forklift but the real value is in increased warehouse productivity. At United Equipment, we offer a wide range of Cat and Elevah order pickers for sale, the ideal pickers for high, narrow or tricky-to-navigate spaces.</p>
