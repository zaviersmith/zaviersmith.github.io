In 2019, counterbalance forklift trucks accounted for more than 60% industry share. Mid-Ohio Forklifts, Inc., has a complete line of heavy-duty equipment to meet your material handling needs.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.
