Most standard forklifts reach heights between 10 to 15 feet, but some can lift as high as 36 feet.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
