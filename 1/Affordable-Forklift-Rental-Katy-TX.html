<p>Layman's Terms: The panhard bar is a vital ingredient when lifting a truck, it helps the suspension not to twist and cause excessive body roll. Equipment dealers generally have a much wider range of rental equipment to meet a broader range of applications. With rated load capacities commonly ranging between 5,500 lbs and 12,000 lbs, popular models include power shift transmission and all-wheel steering as well as a number of additional steering features that allow the operator to position the lift as close to the work area as possible.</p>

<p>Similar to standard counterbalanced forklifts, NA and VNA lifts can support from 3,000 to 12,000 lbs and are available in a range of three or four-stage masts that offer lift heights up to 31 feet, as well as multiple chassis designs. Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
