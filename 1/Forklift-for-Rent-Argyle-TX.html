<h3>CLARK Material Handling Company Argyle TX 76226</h3>
<p>The most complex type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit, which allows your truck to be boosted higher than that of a body kit. Yale has been manufacturing materials handling equipment for over 140 years. Since 1949, Kalmar has been the preferred brand among quality-aware, heavy lift truck drivers and owners. Most rough terrain forklifts have safety glass paneling around the cab, too.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
