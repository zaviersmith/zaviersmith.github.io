They provide equipment for residential, commercial, industrial, and specialized services across all 50 states. Also called a pump truck, a pallet jack is smaller in size than the above mentioned forklifts.</p>
<p>The operation of this switch is designed so that movement of the forklift is not possible while the operator is stocking or picking product.

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
