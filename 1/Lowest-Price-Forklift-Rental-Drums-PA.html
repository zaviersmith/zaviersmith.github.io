Automatic parking brake, electronic speed control and braking system provide enhanced driver safety and also contribute to the BT Pro Lifter's long operating life and low lifetime cost. Heavier loads shift the center of gravity forward even further.</p>
<p>This system is a result of the various types of forklift training available.

Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>
