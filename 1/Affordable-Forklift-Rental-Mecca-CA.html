These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity.

Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks.</p>
