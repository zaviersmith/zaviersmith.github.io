<p>Comprehensive training courses covering the safe and efficient operation of Industrial Reach Truck equipment for operators of all skills and experience.

<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

<p>A rough terrain forklift is durable and adaptable, making an excellent addition to a workforce that works hard across challenging terrain.

<p>Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation. We will conduct a learner analysis to identify the duration of training required for those with limited or no experience, whereas experienced operators can attend a one day Experienced Worker Assessment (Test Only).</p>

<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. I'm talking about the unGodly big, oversized tires, mudflaps, etc type of trucks that look completely and utterly ridiculous. Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits. Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>

<p>And, of course, a big, lifted monster truck just looks extremely cool.

ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors. Most rough terrain forklifts within this range are run by a single joystick that controls all boom functions and hydraulics for simple and efficient operation.</p>
