When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
