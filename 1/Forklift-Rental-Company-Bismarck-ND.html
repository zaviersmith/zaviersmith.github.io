<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Also, aftermarket installations like a lift kit can void the warranty on a lot of vehicles - that's a lot of benefits to leave on the table. Establish a timeline of how long your rental will last. We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town. Pump trucks are primarily used as a pallet jack but do not use any electric power to lift any materials.</p>

<p>Often, a driver will raise the axle to enable the vehicle to turn easier and not have to drag the lift axle sideways through a turn. The order picker is a type of forklift that is made for fast and efficient stock picking.

<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
