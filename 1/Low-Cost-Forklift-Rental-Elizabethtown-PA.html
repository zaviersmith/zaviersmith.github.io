An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it.

Braking applied with the handle in an upright and horizontal position, increases the safety of the truck while a built-in pressure relief valve protects the electric reach stacker from overloads, increasing the reliability.</p>
