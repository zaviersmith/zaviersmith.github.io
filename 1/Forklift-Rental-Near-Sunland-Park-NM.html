<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>
