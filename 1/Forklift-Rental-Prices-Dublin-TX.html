<p>Our AC Orderpicker trucks use fewer amps per cycle, so you'll save on batteries, chargers and downtime. First and foremost, it is important to understand the different types of lift kits. We are the leading and largest supplier of Hydraulic Pallet Truck in North India. Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet to optimise battery performance and shift life.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>The latter allows forklift designers more freedom in ergonomic design.
