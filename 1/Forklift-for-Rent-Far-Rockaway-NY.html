The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of Narrow-Aisle-Rider fork trucks having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 lb at 24-inch load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>
