<h2>The History Of The Hand Pallet Truck Belle Vernon </h2>

A vertical mast rough terrain forklift is designed with two large tires at the front of the machine with two smaller tires at the rear.

<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions.
